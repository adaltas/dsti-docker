# Introduction to Network

Overview - https://docs.docker.com/network/

Serve our website and gitlab behind a reverse proxy.

## Start the private servers

Start the website and GitLab containers

```
cd assets/gitlab
docker-compose up
cd assets/website
docker-compose up
```

Test the containers:

```
# Website
curl http://localhost:11080/
curl http://localhost:11080/dsti -L
# GitLab
curl http://localhost:10080/
```

## Get the environment ready

Create an internal network shared between all containers:

```
docker network create private
docker network inspect private
```

Note the last few lines of each `docker-compose.yml`, we instruct Docker to use this network:

```
networks:
  default:
    external:
      name: private
```

```
sudo bash -c "echo '127.0.0.1    dsti' >> /etc/hosts"
sudo bash -c "echo '127.0.0.1    www.dsti' >> /etc/hosts"
sudo bash -c "echo '127.0.0.1    gitlab.dsti' >> /etc/hosts"
```

Make sure none listen on port 80.

## Use caddy

Start the proxy:

```
cd assets/proxy_caddy
docker-compose up
```

And check the connections:

```
curl http://www.dsti
curl http://gitlab.dsti -L
```

## Use nginx

Start the proxy:

```
cd assets/proxy_nginx
docker-compose up
```

And check the connections:

```
curl http://www.dsti
curl http://gitlab.dsti -L
```
